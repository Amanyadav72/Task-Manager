Got it 👍 Let’s make a **professional `README.md`** for your **Task Manager Flask project**.
This will be **GitHub-ready**, well-structured, and include badges, screenshots (placeholders), setup guide, and future improvements.

# 📋 Task Manager App

A simple **Flask-based Task Manager** web application where users can:

✅ Add tasks
✅ View tasks
✅ Delete tasks

Tasks are stored in a **JSON file (`tasks.json`)**, acting as a lightweight database.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📝 Add new tasks using a form
* 📃 Display all tasks in a list
* ❌ Delete tasks easily
* 🎨 Clean and responsive UI with **custom CSS**
* 📦 Lightweight (no SQL database required — just JSON storage)
